# Crack-propagation- 3D lattice -
Crack propagation simulation in 3D lattice - FCC - Ni lattice 

This simulation helps in creating 3-Dimensional crack propagation in FCC materials- by deleting atoms at the middle-edge of the lattice 
and applying a velocity to upper region --- causing a strain/stress on the deleted region
